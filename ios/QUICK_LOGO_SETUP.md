# Quick Logo Setup 🌱 - One Image Only

## What You Need to Do

Your sprout logo image is already integrated in the code! You just need to add **one image file**.

### Simple 3-Step Process:

1. **Save your logo image** as: **`sprout-logo@3x.png`**
   - Format: PNG (supports transparency)
   - Size: 600x600 pixels or larger (the bigger, the better)

2. **Add to Xcode:**
   - Open `Assets.xcassets` → `sprout-logo.imageset`
   - Drag `sprout-logo@3x.png` into the **3x slot**
   - Leave 1x and 2x empty ✅

3. **Build and run** - Your logo appears everywhere!

### That's It!

You only need **one image file**. iOS automatically handles scaling for all devices. Simple and works perfectly! 🌱

## Where It Appears

✅ **Welcome Screen** - Large animated logo  
✅ **Home Screen** - Logo in sprout card  
✅ **Throughout the app** - Wherever the logo component is used

## Already Set Up

- ✅ Logo component created (`SproutLogo.swift`)
- ✅ Asset catalog structure ready
- ✅ Logo integrated in views
- ✅ Animations and styling configured

**You just need to add the image files!**
